# Repo Template for git-tool compatible layout

unfinished

## Shortcut
FIXME: Explain shortcuts generically and remove logic from actual program, instead replace with generic configurable shortcut

Of course this project will be installed with a shell shortcut. To run the application with GUI just type `powerman`.
If you want to know what arguments can be used put an `-h` behind it.
For example:
`powerman -h` displays the help text for the application it starts.
`powerman update -h` displays the help text for the git-tool. (May change in the future)
The shortcut is installed in /usr/bin. If this folder does not exist yet it will be created.

## Application
FIXME: Explain layout of repo for generic Application here

This is where the fun begins. On startup you will be greeted with a desktop.
These features are yet to be implemented, but you can expect things like Powermanagement (Hey, the original idea behind this Project), AE2 interfaces (including Autocrafting and stuff), redstone control, chat application for communicating with friends on a server and many more! Just wait till we are done (which will be never because there are many ideas)
